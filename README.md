# Name Census top 100

In 2018 we were doing a research project, and we needed to know if a name was male or female. After Googling for hours for 'baby name lists', 'name databases' and 'name datasets' we discovered that there wasn't a complete name database for all countries with first names and gender. Most name database layouts we found different per country, were incomplete or contained non-existing names. That is why we created [Name Census](https://census.name), the most comprehensive name database in the world!  The Name Census top 100 databases is a free database containing the top 100 first names and top 100 surnames for each country.

## Collection methodology
Our name database is created using first names and surnames obtained from governments and cross-referencing with millions of names from publicly available social media profiles. We took all those names and used millions of social media profiles that where publicly available to cross-reference and count each name per country. This way we were sure that the names in our name database are actually used and we could create our popularity metric. We now offer the complete [name database](https://census.name) and the [name parsing service](https://parser.name) as separate services.

## Files
The Name Census top 100 is a name database that consists out of two files; the first names top 100 per country and the surnames top 100 per country. Each file is available as a CSV, SQL and JSON file formatted in UTF-8.
